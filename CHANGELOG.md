## [1.5.0] - 2022-02-28
### Changed
- README updated

### Added
- It's now possible to make your workspace public and accessible through an url like http://wagmi.tryethernal.com, turning it into a public explorer, it can't be activated through the interface yet, but if you are interested in setting this up for you, reach out to Antoine | Ethernal on the Discord server or by email.

## [1.4.2] - 2022-02-23
### Removed
- Accounts are not fetched anymore on workspace creation. This was preventing from connecting to chain without the eth_accounts endpoint

## [1.4.1] - 2022-02-22
### Changed
- Onboarding text when there are issues connecting on remote servers

## [1.4.0] - 2022-02-22
### Changed
- Pagination for blocks & transactions is now done server side

## [1.3.6] - 2022-02-15
### Fixed
- Function calls from proxied contracts are now properly decoded in tracing steps

## [1.3.5] - 2022-02-14
### Fixed
- All parameters were displayed in all inputs on the contract interaction page

## [1.3.4] - 2022-02-14
### Changed
- Better tuples handling on the contract interaction page, they can be entered like this `(param1,param2)`, function signatures on this page are also more precise and will display names when applicable
- Happy Valentine's day (even to those spending it releasing updates & bug fixes) üíù

## [1.3.3] - 2022-02-05
### Changed
- Wording on onboarding modal, to make the process clearer, especially around logging in client side.
- Moving around external links (doc, Discord)

### Added
- Feedback box on the top, maybe this'll work better than Product Road?

## [1.3.2] - 2022-02-03
### Fixed
- RPC server & chain were not displayed properly
- Small race condition where button loading would change state before request is finished
- Not all chains were properly on workspace creation

### Removed
- Obsolete frontend Stripe library

## [1.3.1] - 2022-02-01
### Added
- Avalanche support: contracts metadata can be imported from Snowtrace & the currency is set to Avax when selecting the chain

### Changed
- Technical refactor around multiple chain (only one source of available chains in the frontend now)

## [1.3.0] - 2022-01-31
### Removed
- Trial period: it made sense to have a trial when the transaction tracing feature was only included in the Premium plan, but now that it is available in the free plan as well, it doesn't anymore. The only difference between free/premium is now the 10 contracts/1 workspace limitation. And it doesn't make sense to have a trial for that (the free plan IS the trial already).

### Added
- Custom pricing column in the Billing section

### Changed
- Only include relevant info in the plan explanation in Billing section

## [1.2.10] - 2022-01-30
### Added
- Method name in transactions lists. Hovering it will display a tooltip with the decoded arguments. Updating the ABI updates this in real time. If the method name is not available, the function signature will be displayed instead.

## [1.2.9] - 2022-01-14
### Added
- Link to Product Road board to collect feature requests, you can ask for (almost) anything & I'll build it!!

## [1.2.8] - 2022-01-11
### Added
- It's now possible to edit a workspace server url

## [1.2.7] - 2022-01-07
### Added
- Mixpanel tracking for workspace creation (for better onboarding analytics)

### Fixed
- An analytics helper function wasn't working properly

### Changed
- Wording on the onboarding modal (clearer for Hardhat users)

## [1.2.6] - 2022-01-06
### Changed
- Artifacts stored in rtdb (ast) are deleted after 1 week of not being updated, for free users only. It's only useful for reading storage, and takes up a lot of space, increasing the bill.

## [1.2.5] - 2021-12-24
### Fixed
- Error handling when some write methods are failing
- Merry Christmas üéÖ!

## [1.2.4] - 2021-12-21
### Changed
- Prevents from restarting Stripe subscription portal while the subscription webhook is still being processed, better messaging too.

### Removed
- RPC requests sent from the server. All is sent from the browser now. Might need some remote chains to be configured to accept app.tryethernal.com as a domain name but sending requests from Firebase Functions was really buggy

## [1.2.3] - 2021-12-21
### Fixed
- Bumped ethers.js to 5.5.0, fixing bug happening when a Solidity function has the same name than a javascript function (???? see https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/1432)

## [1.2.2] - 2021-12-20
### Added
- Data URI for application/json is parsed and formatted when returned by methods

## [1.2.1] - 2021-12-20
### Added
- Backend tracking to Mixpanel: an event is sent when the following actions happen: block sync, trace sync, artifact sync, contract imported, contract removed, signup, plan change. No blockchain data is sent, only user id, current plan, stripe subscription status, trial date.

### Changed
- Values emitted by events and returned by methods are now automatically parsed and formatted depending on their type. It's possible to switch between parsed/raw data

### Fixed
- Wording related to transaction tracing

## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-14
### Added
- Token balances changes on transaction page (between previous/current block)
- Token transfers on transaction page (based on Transfer event)
- Contracts are automatically tagged with "erc20" and "proxy" tags in the "Contracts" page
- New tokens pages that lists all ERC20 tokens
- On an address page that is a token, there is a new tab that shows the token balance in the latest block for all tracked addresses (addresses in the "Accounts" page)
- On transaction page, uint256 values are easily convertible to int by clicking on the button next to it

### Changed
- Transaction tracing is now included in the free plan
- Contract matching with local or mainnet is done asynchronously. A process in the frontend is monitoring new contracts on Firebase and triggers the matching process (this is done in the frontend so requests can be sent to the chain)
- Contract names are now displayed instead of addresses when applicable
- Function calls and events are now properly decoded with proxy contracts

### Fixed
- Properly set email in Logrocket analytics for premium accounts

## [1.1.4] - 2021-11-18
### Added

## [1.0.1] - 2021-10-25
