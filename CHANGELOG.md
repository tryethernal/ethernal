## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.3] - 2021-12-21
### Fixed
- Bumped ethers.js to 5.5.0, fixing bug happening when a Solidity function has the same name than a javascript function (???? see https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/1432)

## [1.2.2] - 2021-12-20
### Added
- Data URI for application/json is parsed and formatted when returned by methods

## [1.2.1] - 2021-12-20
### Added
- Backend tracking to Mixpanel: an event is sent when the following actions happen: block sync, trace sync, artifact sync, contract imported, contract removed, signup, plan change. No blockchain data is sent, only user id, current plan, stripe subscription status, trial date.

### Changed
- Values emitted by events and returned by methods are now automatically parsed and formatted depending on their type. It's possible to switch between parsed/raw data

### Fixed
- Wording related to transaction tracing

## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-14
### Added
- Token balances changes on transaction page (between previous/current block)
- Token transfers on transaction page (based on Transfer event)
- Contracts are automatically tagged with "erc20" and "proxy" tags in the "Contracts" page
- New tokens pages that lists all ERC20 tokens
- On an address page that is a token, there is a new tab that shows the token balance in the latest block for all tracked addresses (addresses in the "Accounts" page)
- On transaction page, uint256 values are easily convertible to int by clicking on the button next to it

### Changed
- Transaction tracing is now included in the free plan
- Contract matching with local or mainnet is done asynchronously. A process in the frontend is monitoring new contracts on Firebase and triggers the matching process (this is done in the frontend so requests can be sent to the chain)
- Contract names are now displayed instead of addresses when applicable
- Function calls and events are now properly decoded with proxy contracts

### Fixed
- Properly set email in Logrocket analytics for premium accounts

## [1.1.4] - 2021-11-18
