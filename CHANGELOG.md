## [3.17.1] - 2023-08-10
### Fixed
- Bug when google auth json file is missing

## [3.17.0] - 2023-08-10
### Added
- Anyone can now spin up a public explorer
  - UI that lists all your explorers
  - Possibility to create an explorer from an existing workspace or a new one
  - 3 different plans are available, depending on the level of customization you need
  - From the UI, you can customize:
    - Native token
    - Domain names (you can add as many as you want)
    - Colors / Font / Logo / Favicon / Banner / Custom links
  - Once you start an explorer, blocks will start syncing automatically
  - For current explorers, you don't need to take any actions, but you are now able to manage your subscription and explorer settings directly.
  - For self-hosting: docker-compose.prod.yml is not ready yet. However, the code already works in this mode (that mostly means that you don't need to integrate Stripe). So if you want to run it already, you should just need to add the pm2-server service to it from docker-compose.yml
  - This is just a first version, there will be more regular & incremental improvements from here.

## [1.4.2] - 2022-02-23

### Removed
- Trial period: it made sense to have a trial when the transaction tracing feature was only included in the Premium plan, but now that it is available in the free plan as well, it doesn't anymore. The only difference between free/premium is now the 10 contracts/1 workspace limitation. And it doesn't make sense to have a trial for that (the free plan IS the trial already).

## [1.2.6] - 2022-01-06
### Changed
- Artifacts stored in rtdb (ast) are deleted after 1 week of not being updated, for free users only. It's only useful for reading storage, and takes up a lot of space, increasing the bill.

## [1.2.5] - 2021-12-24
### Fixed
- Error handling when some write methods are failing
- Merry Christmas 🎅!

## [1.2.4] - 2021-12-21
### Changed

### Removed
- RPC requests sent from the server. All is sent from the browser now. Might need some remote chains to be configured to accept app.tryethernal.com as a domain name but sending requests from Firebase Functions was really buggy

## [1.2.3] - 2021-12-21
### Fixed

### Added

- New tokens pages that lists all ERC20 tokens
- On an address page that is a token, there is a new tab that shows the token balance in the latest block for all tracked addresses (addresses in the "Accounts" page)
- On transaction page, uint256 values are easily convertible to int by clicking on the button next to it

### Changed
- Transaction tracing is now included in the free plan
- Contract matching with local or mainnet is done asynchronously. A process in the frontend is monitoring new contracts on Firebase and triggers the matching process (this is done in the frontend so requests can be sent to the chain)
- Contract names are now displayed instead of addresses when applicable
- Function calls and events are now properly decoded with proxy contracts

### Fixed
- Properly set email in Logrocket analytics for premium accounts
